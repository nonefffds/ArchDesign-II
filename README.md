A publish page for my designing courses.

This repository is for showing the progress of me - a complete architectural noob can do what in the architecture designing courses.

This repository will store Architectural Designing files/publications in School Year 2 (2021-2022).

Update in every Monday & Thursday during the semester, until next year.

## Software/tools Used

### The first project(2021-1-1) was using

- SketchUP
- AutoCAD 2022 (CAD.dwg file must be opened with AutoCAD + TZ Arch T20 v7.0)
- TianZheng Arch. T20 v7.0
- Enscape
- Affinity Photo/Designer/Publisher

### The rest projects was/is/will be using

- ArchiCAD
- Enscape
- Twinmotion w/ Direct Link (& Epic Game Store)
- Affinity Photo/Designer/Publisher

Pretty exceptional choices, huh.


#### Future path

But maybe I'll choose to try out with more options, here's some further (might be) *workable* choices:

- Vectorworks Architect
- Revit
- Edificius
- Tekla (by Trimble)

And some non-BIM solutions for just enhancing my 3D modeling ability:

- 3DS MAX / maya
- Unreal Engine (5)
- Blender
- Rhino
- FreeCAD

I'll try them out someday and considering them as some challenges.

(List has no order, include but not limited to these software. If I have more interesting things found, I might list them & try them all some day.)

## Constructure

### Folders

This Repositoryâ€™s root folder is ordered chronologically. Format: YEAR-Grade-ProjectNo. (E.g: 2021-1-2)

All project related file are stored in the corresponding folder.

### Branches

Currently there's 2 branches, the main branch is for the final works, and the wasted branch is for the plans that are/were abandoned but needed for store.

### Releases

I'll publish my model's render executable file in the release section.

Tags are versions.

These file are generated with Enscape, can only be open with Windows.

## Misc.

I don't accept merge / pull request for this repository(except from @nonefffds for maintenance), this is just for demonstration & reference.
