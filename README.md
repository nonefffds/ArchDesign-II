# ArchDesign-II

A publication page for my designing courses.

This repository is for showing the progress of me - a complete architectural noob can do what in the architecture designing courses.

This repository will store Architectural Designing files/publications in School Year 2 (2021-2022).

## Software/tools Used

- ArchiCAD
- Enscape
- Twinmotion w/ Direct Link (& Epic Game Store)
- Affinity Photo/Designer/Publisher

Pretty exceptional choices, huh.

## Publish

I'll publish my model's render executable file with the publish feature.

These file are generated with Enscape automatically.

Performance is needed.
